        Google Terms of Service for Your Personal Use

Welcome! By using Google's search engine services ("Google Search
Services"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions
(the "Terms of Service").

*Content Linked to by Google*

The sites displayed as search results or linked to by Google Search
Services are developed by people over whom Google exercises no control.
The search results that appear from Google's indices are indexed by
Google's automated machinery and computers, and Google cannot and does
not screen the sites before including them in the indices from which
such automated search results are gathered. A search using Google Search
Services may produce search results and links to sites that some people
find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive. We cannot guarantee
that a Google search will not locate unintended or objectionable content
and assume no responsibility for the content of any site included in any
search results or otherwise linked to by the Google Search Services.

*Personal Use Only*

The Google Search Services are made available for your personal,
non-commercial use only. You may not use the Google Search Services to
sell a product or service, or to increase traffic to your Web site for
commercial reasons, such as advertising sales. You may not take the
results from a Google search and reformat and display them, or mirror
the Google home page or results pages on your Web site. You may not
"meta-search" Google. If you want to make commercial use of the Google
Search Services, you must enter into an agreement with Google to do so
in advance. Please contact us
<http://services.google.com/licensing/request> for more information.

If you are interested in adding a Google search box to your web site or
your company's web site, we encourage you to do so <searchcode.html>.

*No Automated Querying*

You may not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system
without express permission in advance from Google. Note that "sending
automated queries" includes, among other things:

    * using any software which sends queries to Google to determine how
      a website or webpage "ranks" on Google for various queries;
    * "meta-searching" Google; and
* performing "offline" searches on Google.

Please do not write to Google to request permission to "meta-search"
Google for a research project, as such requests will not be granted.

reason, and without notice, including the right to terminate with or
without notice, without liability to you, any other user or any third
party. We reserve the right to modify these Terms of Service from time
to time without notice. Please review these Terms of Service from time
to time so that you will be apprised of any changes.

*Intellectual Property Policy *

It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that
comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. For directions and

computer equipment failures, telecommunication equipment failures, other
equipment failures, electrical power failures, strikes, labor disputes,

materials, fires, floods, storms, explosions, acts of God, war,
governmental actions, orders of domestic or foreign courts or tribunals,
non-performance of third parties, or loss of or fluctuations in heat,
light, or air conditioning.

*Requests for Removal of Links or Cached Materials*

Google occasionally receives requests from people to remove links from
its indices. Although Google reserves the right to address such requests
individually, the general approach that Google takes reflects the
following principles:

Google's indices consist of information that has been identified,
indexed and compiled through an automated process with no advance review
by human beings. Given the enormous volume of web site information
added, deleted, and changed on a frequent basis, Google cannot and does
not screen anything made available through its indices. For each web
site reflected in Google's indices, if either (i) a site owner restricts
access to his or her web site or (ii) a site is taken down from the web,
then, upon receipt of a request by the site owner or a third party in
the second instance, Google would consider on a case-by-case basis
requests to remove the link to that site from its indices. However, if
the operator of the site does not take steps to prevent it, the
automatic facilities used to create the indices are likely to find that
site and index it again in a relatively short amount of time.

Google stores many web pages in its cache to retrieve for users as a
back-up in case the page's server temporarily fails. Site owners may
block Google from returning cached versions of their pages by using the
NOARCHIVE meta-tag. Site owners may also request immediate removal of
cached page from the Google Search Service. Google evaluates such
requests for the immediate removal of cached content on a case-by-case
basis and does not guarantee that every request will be granted. The
steps necessary to remove cached pages, and to prevent a site from being
cached and/or included in the indices are described in the Google FAQ
<webmasters/faq.html>, accessible from the home page of this site.

*Miscellaneous Provisions*

These Terms of Service will be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of California, without giving effect to its
conflict of laws provisions or your actual state or country of
residence. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any
provision or portion of the Terms of Service to be unenforceable, the
remainder of the Terms of Service will continue in full force and effect.

These Terms of Service constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes and
replaces all prior or contemporaneous understandings or agreements,
written or oral, regarding such subject matter. Any waiver of any
provision of the Terms of Service will be effective only if in writing
and signed by Google.
